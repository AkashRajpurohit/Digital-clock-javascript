### The Digital Font is also available so make sure to keep the font file in the same folder or mention the entire path where it is downloaded.

### The Style in CSS is bare minimum which can be customised depending on your requirement as in this repo I just want to show how you can make a actual working clock using pure JavaScript without using any frameworks (Not even jQuery)

### Feel free to to make you own changes and commit to this Repository :)
